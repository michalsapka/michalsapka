### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is MichaÅ‚, and I am a 30 something father, husband, and software engineer living in KrakÃ³w, Poland. This site is, in the early stages of creation. I plan to dedicate this space to technology, boomer things and geek culture. You can subscribe to RSS at any time. I'm not on Twitter, Instagram nor TikTok. I have an account on Facebook, but I don't use it. 

You can find me at https://michal.sapka.me
